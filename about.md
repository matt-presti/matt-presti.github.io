# About This Website

Welcome to my professional development portfolio! This website documents my journey as a Computer Science student at the University of Colorado Boulder, with a focus on my personal project: **InvestaTrack** - designed to demonstrate the skillset I've developed throughout my Computer Science degree.

## What is InvestaTrack?

InvestaTrack is a digital investment portfolio tracker that I'm building using Spring Boot and Java. This full-stack application combines my growing interest in financial technology with hands-on experience in enterprise Java development. The project allows users to track their investment portfolios, monitor performance, and analyze their financial data in real-time.

## Weekly Blog Updates

The **Weekly Blog** section is where I document my development progress, challenges encountered, and lessons learned throughout the project lifecycle. Each post follows a structured format covering:

- **What I accomplished** during the week
- **Plans for the upcoming week**
- **Obstacles and challenges** I'm facing
- **Reflections** on my development process and how to improve

These posts serve as both a personal learning tool and a way to demonstrate my problem-solving approach, technical decision-making, and growth as a developer.

## About Me

I'm a Computer Science student with an interesting path that brought me to tech through healthcare and the outdoors. I really enjoy working with people and have found that my experience in healthcare management has given me a different perspective on teamwork and communication. I'm genuinely fascinated by how technology can help improve our livelihood, our understanding of the world, and our ability to connect with eachother in meaningful ways. 

I previously worked as a fly fishing guide which was an incredible experience that taught me a lot about patience, connecting with people, and the joy of shared experiences. These days, I love the challenge of building applications and figuring out how different pieces of code work together.

When I'm not at my computer, I'm usually seeking adventures in the Colorado mountains whether that's fishing, skiing, mountain biking, rafting, or hiking. Outdoor recreation has always been an integral part of my life and my basis for maintaining balance and connection. 

## Purpose & Goals

This website serves multiple purposes:
- **Document my technical growth and learning process**
- **Showcase my development approach and problem-solving skills** 
- **Demonstrate consistency in project execution and reflection**
- **Provide insight into my work style for potential employers and collaborators**

I believe that showing the journey—not just the final product—gives a more complete picture of my capabilities as a developer and team member.
