# About This Website

Welcome to my professional development portfolio! This website documents my journey as a Computer Science student at the University of Colorado Boulder, with a focus on my personal project: **InvestaTrack** - designed to demonstrate the skillset I've developed throughout my Computer Science degree.

## What is InvestaTrack?

InvestaTrack is a digital investment portfolio tracker that I'm building using Spring Boot and Java. This full-stack application combines my growing interest in financial technology with hands-on experience in enterprise Java development. The project allows users to track their investment portfolios, monitor performance, and analyze their financial data in real-time.

## Weekly Blog Updates

The **Weekly Blog** section is where I document my development progress, challenges encountered, and lessons learned throughout the project lifecycle. Each post follows a structured format covering:

- **What I accomplished** during the week
- **Plans for the upcoming week**
- **Obstacles and challenges** I'm facing
- **Reflections** on my development process and how to improve

These posts serve as both a personal learning tool and a way to demonstrate my problem-solving approach, technical decision-making, and growth as a developer.

## About Me

I'm a Computer Science student with a unique background combining technical expertise and real-world management experience from my time in healthcare operations. What sets me apart is my proven leadership abilities, strong communication skills, and passion for collaborative problem-solving.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring Colorado's outdoors through skiing, mountain biking, white-water rafting, and other adventures. This love for outdoor challenges keeps me energized and provides the perfect balance to long development sessions.

## Purpose & Goals

This website serves multiple purposes:
- **Document my technical growth** and learning process
- **Showcase my development approach** and problem-solving skills  
- **Demonstrate consistency** in project execution and reflection
- **Provide insight** into my work style for potential employers and collaborators

I believe that showing the journey—not just the final product—gives a more complete picture of my capabilities as a developer and team member.
