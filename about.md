# About This Website
Welcome to my professional development portfolio! This website documents my journey as a Computer Science student at the University of Colorado Boulder, showcasing my technical projects and weekly development blog where I share progress updates, challenges, and reflections on building and application called **InvestaTrack** - my investment portfolio tracker built with Spring Boot and Java.

## About Me
I earned my molecular biology degree from Colorado College before working as a fly fishing guide in Colorado. As a lifelong angler and fly tier, I've learned that fishing teaches valuable skills that translate surprisingly well to programming - juggling multiple variables, reading environmental conditions, understanding complex systems, and choosing the right approach from many options.

I transitioned into healthcare as a medical scribe, eventually managing the scribe program at an orthopedic clinic. This leadership role was my most formative professional experience, challenging me to develop assertiveness, support team members, and build strong collaborative relationships. The management experience taught me as much about myself as it did about leading others.

Now I'm applying that same systems thinking and collaborative approach to backend development and machine learning. My scientific background gives me a unique perspective on data analysis and problem-solving in tech. When I'm not coding, I'm exploring Colorado's mountains through fishing, rafting, skiing, hiking, or mountain biking.
