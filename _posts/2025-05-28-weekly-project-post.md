**Weekly Project Post #1.**

**What did you do last week?** I dedicated most of my time to researching and trying to decide on a project idea, which has proven to be much more challenging than I initially anticipated. I spent significant time analyzing job postings to understand what skillsets and technologies are currently in demand.

Two main directions have captured my interest. First, I'm considering a project related to embedded programming, as I find this area interesting. I'm exploring options with Arduino or Raspberry Pi. Arduino for lower-level hardware control with GPIO pins, sensors, and actuators, or Raspberry Pi for more complex projects that could integrate IoT capabilities or data collection systems. One idea is to build an automated garden monitoring system that my mom could use for her flowerbeds and plants, since she's highly passionate about gardening but often away from the house. This system could provide real-time feedback on soil conditions, moisture levels.

Secondly, I'm exploring Java and Spring Boot projects. A close friend who works as a senior software engineer at a financial company develops backend systems using Spring Boot, opening my eyes to potential career opportunities in enterprise software development. For Spring Boot projects, I'm considering building a RESTful API for a personal finance tracker with user authentication and real-time notifications.

I'm also creating my GitHub Pages website and have been doing considerable internal reflection about what truly interests me in computer science and my long-term career goalsâ€”this has arguably been the most challenging aspect of the process.

**What do you plan to do this week?** This week, I plan to finalize my project decision and begin the initial setup/design phase. I will have to choose between the embedded programming path and the Spring Boot backend development route, then start setting up the necessary development environment and tools. I also plan to complete my GitHub Pages website and write my project proposal.

**Are there any impediments in your way?** My biggest obstacle has been "analysis paralysis" as it's called. I know I've been overthinking the decision and trying to optimize for job market demands rather than following my genuine interests. I recognize I've been putting pressure on myself to choose a project that maximizes employability, which is likely not the most helpful approach.

**Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?** I can improve my process by being more decisive and trusting my instincts. I recognize that concerning myself less with the current state of the job market and not trying to create the "perfect" resume-boosting project would be beneficial. Moving forward, I will focus on choosing something that genuinely interests me, as this will likely lead to a higher quality project than one chosen purely for strategic reasons. I need to remember that any well-executed project will demonstrate valuable skills to employers.
